### Set up an environment

* Download Latest Android Studio and open this cloned repo as a new project.

### Project Structure
* This sample project contains two module
* voltsdk  -> This the module which contains aar(sdk) code base, if current open repo is volt-android-sdk-example then you wont see this module since an aar file has already been created and placed in there in libs folder of app module.
* app -> This dir contain volt sample app code

### VoltSDK Android library generation

* In order to generate aar lib for android we need to build the project from root using below command
  module:
  Note-: if you are in volt-android-sdk-example then you wont need this step as aar is already been generated and placed in libs dir of app module
```
  ./gradlw clean build
```
After successful run of above command the aar and apk(VoltMoneySample) will be generated on below location:

```
   volt-release.aar -> voltsdk/build/outputs/aar/volt-release.aar
   app-debug.apk -> app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

**Note** - As `aar` file doesn't include dependency from shared module, while create a new android
project and adding this `aar` as lib, don't forget to add all dependency from from android section
of common build.gradle.

In this case we need to include below dependencies in project  `build.gradle` file :

```
    implementation files('libs/voltsdk-release.aar')
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'
    implementation 'androidx.browser:browser:1.5.0-alpha02'
```
### Invoke VoltSDK
* In order to open voltSDK client must have to create Volt SDK instance by passing certain value(see below):
  ```
  var voltInstance = VoltSDKInstance(contex,
                "app_key",
                "app_secret",
                "ref",
                "primary_color",
                "secondary_color",
               "partner_platform " )
  ```
After creating voltsdk instance there are below two way by which VoltMoney app can be invoke
1. Invoke VoltSDK by passing user info(create app fun call)
```
voltInstance.startApplication(dob,email,mobileNumber,pan)
voltInstance.invokeVoltSdk(mobileNumber)

```
2. Invoke VoltSDK without creating user
```
voltInstance.invokeVoltSdk(mobileNumber)
```
